Introducing Brutal Wasteland, my take on making Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 tougher and more realistic. Maxed out at 255 plugins and over 865+ mods, you'll get new gameplay mechanics, enhanced textures, and overhauled locations. In this version, headshots are fatal, and everythinggg is extra lethal. Read more below!

<summary>Show Modlists and Load Orders</summary>

**[Brutal Wasteland  profile](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/brutal-wasteland)**

**There will be no support if you decide to add, delete, disable mods, or mess with the ini’s etc. You can disable or enable mods in the optional section of the mod list but must follow the load order notes!**

If you have any questions, there's a FAQ down below.

**Endorse if you enjoy the modlists or at the very least endorse the mods you download from the list.**

### Recommended Specs

- **SSD: NVME for less stuttering and drastically improved loading times (a SATA SSD is fine too).**
- **CPU: Any Multi-core processor (3.5GHz or more).**
- **RAM: 16GB+.**
- **GPU: 6GB+ as a baseline for 1080p, 8GB+ for 1440p, and 10GB+ for 4k (If you plan on using NVR, you'll need an RTX 2060 for Ambient Occlusion and Shadows on. If you have a GTX 1660 ti or below, Ambient Occlusion and Shadows must be off for stable framerate.)**

### Requirements

- **Windows 10 or higher (64-bit).**
- **At least 70-80 GB of free drive space, game included.**
- **English copy of Fallout New Vegas with all official DLC on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/sub/13435).**
- **A [Nexus Mods](https://users.nexusmods.com/register) account, preferably with a premium subscription.**
- **Download and install [Visual C++](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/) (extract the archive and run the included install_all.bat as an administrator to install all the required libraries at once).**
- **Download and install [DirectX Runtime Libraries](https://www.microsoft.com

/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) and [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer).**
- **The latest GPU drivers ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx), [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support), or [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19344/intel-graphics-windows-dch-drivers.html)).**
- **An archiving tool ([7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) is recommended).**
- **A text editor ([Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is recommended, but the default Windows notepad will work).**

[Visual C++](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/) and [.NET Framework 

4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer) are needed for MO2. If they are already installed, it should notify you.

I suggest restarting your PC after installing the drivers.

### Uninstalling

You must have Fallout New Vegas clean installed if you want to avoid issues!

**If you never installed or modded Fallout New Vegas, this can be skipped.**

Instructions:

1. Uninstall Fallout New Vegas through Steam.
2. Next, navigate to your Steam directory Steam\steamapps\common. If there is a Fallout New Vegas folder there, delete it.
3. Navigate to the INI folder Documents\My Games\FalloutNV.
4. If you have save files you care about, make a backup folder outside of the FalloutNV folder.
5. Delete everything inside that folder.

If you see any mod added files in your Fallout New Vegas folder, delete them.

### Reinstalling

**If you already have a separate Steam library outside of User Account Control protected folders, this can be skipped!**

The purpose of reinstalling is to relocate the game files to a better directory. User Account Control protected folders for the game or any modding tools have a risk of causing issues down the line. We'll be using [Steam Library Setup Tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/releases) for Steam.

Instructions:

1. Exit out of Steam using the system tray or Task Manager.
2. Run the file and add a new entry by clicking Add Row.
3. Type the chosen path under path C:\Games\Steam.
4. Click Accept then Yes if prompted to create a new folder.
5. The tool will ask to exit, select OK.
6. Open Steam and go to your Library.
7. Find Fallout: New Vegas in the list and select Install.
8. Under Install to; select the library folder created with the tool, which is the second C:\ entry if you are installing on the main drive.
9. If you still do not see your new library, restart your PC.
10. Select Next then wait for the install to finish.

**Make sure FO3 and FNV is set to English in Steam!**

Instructions:

1. Right-click on Fallout New Vegas in your Steam library.
2. Select properties and switch to the language tab.
3. Make sure it's set to English.

After reinstalling the game, it is important to launch it at least once through Steam so that the registry keys are set up. Otherwise, certain modding tools may not recognize the game. Upon launching the game, the default set of INI files will also be regenerated.

Instructions:

1. Find Fallout New Vegas in your Games Library and hit Play.
2. You will be prompted with a notification that Fallout New Vegas is configuring your video settings, click OK.
3. Click OK again to the next window and hit Exit to close the launcher.

The preset that is selected now will be useless moving forward. Brutal Wasteland uses its own set of INI files.

### Wabbajack Installation

**All Wabbajack lists use a self-contained portable instance of MO2 that ships with the list. Do not add it as a profile on your existing global instance if you already have one. Fallout New Vegas and the Wabbajack list must be installed on the same drive!**

**If you are installing the list from Nexus, unzip the zip file you downloaded. Then, inside Wabbajack, go to “Install From Disk”. Find the .wabba file you just unzipped and select it. The Brutal Wasteland FNV folder must be on an SSD and can’t be inside the Wabbajack install folder or the Fallout New Vegas folder.**

**For the Website version.**

Instructions:

1. Download the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) executable.
2. Move the downloaded file to a location of your choice.
3. Double-click Wabbajack.exe. It will automatically download and install the latest version.

- **A [MOD:PUB](https://mod.pub/account/register) account so we can download TTW later in the guide.**

I suggest restarting your PC after installing the drivers.

### Uninstalling

You must have Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 clean installed if you want to avoid issues!

**If you never installed or modded Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3, this can be skipped.**

Instructions:

1. Uninstall Fallout New Vegas on Steam and Fallout 3 through Steam, Epic Games, or GOG.
2. For Steam, navigate to your Steam directory Steam\steamapps\common. If there is a Fallout New Vegas/Fallout3 folder there, delete it.
3. Navigate to the INI folder Documents\My Games\FalloutNV.
4. If you have save files you care about, make a backup folder outside of the FalloutNV.
5. Delete everything inside the Fallout New Vegas folder. Do the same for Fallout 3.

**If you see any mod-added files in your Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3 folder, delete them!**

### Reinstalling

**If you already have a separate Steam library outside of User Account Control protected folders, this can be skipped!**

The purpose of reinstalling is to relocate the game files to a better directory. User Account Control protected folders for the game or any modding tools have a risk of causing issues down the line.

**For Fallout New Vegas, we'll be using [Steam Library Setup Tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/releases). For Fallout 3, if on Steam, use [Steam Library Setup Tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/releases). For the GOG version of Fallout 3, make sure the install path looks like this: C:\Games\gog galaxy. For the Epic Games version of Fallout 3, the install path should look like this: C:\Games\Epic games.**
**You can also use winaerotweaker to "take ownership" of the steam folder on the c drive**

Instructions:

1. Exit out of Steam using the system tray or Task Manager.
2. Run the file as admin if

 you installed Steam in the program file.
3. Add a new entry by clicking Add Row.
4. Type the chosen path under path C:\Games\Steam.
5. Click Accept then Yes if prompted to create a new folder.
6. The tool will ask to exit, select OK.
7. Open Steam and go to your Library.
8. Find Fallout New Vegas in the list and select Install.
9. Under Install to; select the library folder created with the tool, which is the second C:\ entry if you are installing on the main drive.
10. If you still do not see your new library, restart your PC.
11. Select Next then wait for the install to finish. Do the same for Fallout 3.

**Make sure both games are set to English in Steam!**

Instructions:

1. Right-click on Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 in your Steam Library.
2. Select Properties and switch to the Language tab.
3. Make sure it's set to English.

After reinstall

ing the game, it is important to launch it at least once through Steam so that the registry keys are set up. Otherwise, certain modding tools may not recognize the game. Upon launching the game, the default set of INI files will also be regenerated.

Instructions:

1. Find Fallout New Vegas in your Games Library and hit Play.
2. You will be prompted with a notification that Fallout New Vegas is configuring your video settings, click OK.
3. Click OK again to the next window and hit Exit to close the launcher. Do the same for Fallout 3.

The tweaked settings made by the FNV/FO3 launcher will be useless moving forward. Brutal Wasteland uses its own set of INI files.

### Wabbajack Installation

**All Wabbajack lists use a self-contained portable instance of MO2 that ships with the list. Do not add it as a profile on your existing global instance if you already have one. Fallout New Vegas and the Wabbajack list must be installed on the same drive for less stuttering!**

**If you are installing the list from Nexus, unzip the zip file you downloaded. Then, inside Wabbajack, go to “Install From Disk”. Find the .wabba file you just unzipped and select it. The Brutal Wasteland folder must be on an SSD and can’t be inside the Wabbajack install folder or the Fallout New Vegas folder.**

**Website version is down below.**

Instructions:

1. Download the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) executable.
2. Move the downloaded file to a location of your choice.
3. Double-click Wabbajack.exe. It will automatically download and install the latest version.

### Downloading Brutal Wasteland

Instructions:

1. Once you have Wabbajack running, click the cogwheel up top and log into your Nexus account.
2. Go back and click browse modlists on the left.
3. Brutal Wasteland can be found under the Fallout New Vegas drop-down in the Wabbajack UI.
4. Make sure you have Show unofficial lists checked at the top of the page.
5. Press the download modlist button to take you through the installation.

### Download Location

The Mod Organizer 2 downloads folder within your Brutal Wasteland folder will automatically be chosen as the download location. However, this is mostly a waste of space as the downloaded mod archives are only required for the initial installation and later updates but not for gameplay. I recommend changing the Download location to a folder on a hard drive with plenty of free storage space and outside of user account control. You can reuse the download folders from different Wabbajack lists for the same game.

Example install path: C:\Modlists\MO2\Brutal Wasteland.

### Brutal Wasteland Installation

**After filling in the installation and download directories, click the start button on the left. If you have Nexus Premium it'll download the required mod files and setup automatically. If that's not the case, you'll have to click through the mod pages and download manually.**

### Mod Organizer 2

**All the mods are installed in Mod Organizer 2 which is required to play the setup. You must always launch Fallout through Mod Organizer 2.**

Instructions:

1. Navigate to your Brutal Wasteland installation directory.
2. Double-click ModOrganizer.exe.

You must always launch the game through MO2! Select "Brutal Wasteland" when ready to play

![MO2](https://i.imgur.com/Ey4cwfu.jpeg)

**If you are getting a pop-up saying the ini file is read-only:**

1. Select clear the read-only flag.
2. Then change always ask at the bottom.

Make sure to launch the Fallout New Vegas launcher through MO2 to set your resolution or else you won't get a resolution that matches your display resolution.

![Launcher](https://i.imgur.com/BYKRWQy.png)

### TTW Installer

This step is needed so we can enable TTW through Mod Organizer 2. Make sure Steam is closed!

Instructions:

1. Make an account for MOD:PUB then download the [3.3.2a Installer](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/dl) and extract the contents of the archive anywhere outside of the default Windows folders.
2. Open Mod Organizer 2 and select the folder icon button at the top and select open mods folder.
3. Create a folder named [NoDelete] Tale of Two Wastelands in the mods folder and then copy its path.
4. Refresh MO2 and under the TTW esm's separator place the newly created mod.
5. Close Mod Organizer 2.
6. Find the TTW Installer folder, right-click the TTW Install.exe, and select Run As Administrator.
7. In the installer, verify that the automatically set file paths for both your Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas installations are correct.
8. Paste the path you copied in step 3 into the install path.
9. Install.
10. Open MO2 and find [NoDelete] Tale of Two Wastelands in your modlist under the TTW ESM's separator and make sure to check it.
11. Make sure YupTTW in your load order is placed under your Tale of Two Wastelands esm.

You can now delete Fallout 3 since it's not needed.

### Adding Exceptions to Defender

This is required because Windows can block Mod Organizer 2 and mod files from loading due to how the mod organizer virtualized file system works.

Instructions:

1. Open Windows Security.
2. Open Virus and threat protection.
3. Click Manage settings under virus and threat protection settings.
4. Scroll down and click Add or remove exclusions under exclusions.
5. Add a folder exclusion and point it to the folder Mod Organizer 2 is in.
6. Add another exclusion for your game folder (the game’s root folder, not documents).

If you are using a third-party antivirus, you will need to find the exceptions menu and add those two folders mentioned previously.

### FNV 4GB Patch

Allows the game to use 4GB of RAM and makes the default executable auto-load NVSE, which is safer than using the NVSE executable.

Instructions:

1. In your installation location for Wabbajack, open the performance tweaks folder then the 4 GB patcher folder.
2. Extract FNVpatch into the game’s root folder.
3. Double-click on FNVpatch.exe to run it.
4. A command prompt window will open and should say FalloutNV.exe Patched!
5. Close the command prompt and a file named FalloutNV_Backup.exe should appear in the game's root folder.

### Manual Downloads

At the moment you'll need to manually download these:

- **[BSP Textures 2](https://www.moddb.com/addons/start/252227)**
- **[Vanilla UI Extension](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/260369)**
- **[New Vegas Multiplayer](https://github.com/NVMP/ClientDistribution/releases/download/6.13/build_release_client.zip)** - install this via root kit with proper directory setup /Root/nvmp

Install all of them onto MO2. Put [NoDelete] at the beginning of the mod’s name. Examples: [NoDelete] bsp_textures and [NoDelete] Vanilla_UI_Extension.

### Patching ySI - Sorting Icons for M.U.X

1. Search for ySI - Sorting Icons in the bottom filter bar for MO2.
   ![Search](https://i.imgur.com/DhoKedV.png)
2. Right-click on it and then click open explorer.
3. Locate the file ySI.xml inside Data\Menus\ySI\.
4. Open this file with Notepad++.
5. Click search then find.
   ![Find](https://i.imgur.com/p6AhK5q.png)
6. Type VUI+.
   ![Type](https://i.imgur.com/iCoiCGX.png)
7. Replace the VUI+ section with the following code:
   ```xml
   <_ySIWidth_2> 18 </_ySIWidth_2>
   <_ySIHeight_2> 18 </_ySIHeight_2>
   <_ySISpaceUp_2> 4 </_ySISpaceUp_2>
   <_ySISpaceLeft_2> -5 </_ySISpaceLeft_2>
   <_ySISpaceRight_2> 5 </_ySISpaceRight_2>

### NVR

Instructions:

1. Download [NVR](https://discord.gg/r8EFG5YGBj) Version 03/29/2024 in the [TES Reloaded](https://

discord.com/invite/r8EFG5YGBj) Discord located under #nightly-builds channel.
2. Manually install the file into Mod Organizer 2 by clicking the CD icon located on the top left of the screen.
3. Put [NoDelete] at the beginning of the mod’s name. Example: [NoDelete] NewVegasReloaded.

- Download both the modlist and load order here:
  [Brutal Wasteland TTW  profile](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/brutal-wasteland)  

- Paste them into your profiles located here Brutal Wasteland FNV\profiles\Brutal Wasteland TTW - .
- Make sure to refresh MO2 after doing so to see the changes.
- You will need to download the modlist and load order every update.

The modlist and load order will sort everything out so no need to adjust the priority for anything. Make sure these are

 checked in your load order.

![Load Order](https://i.imgur.com/bOUnXH2.png)

### Reshade

Instructions:

1. Download [ReShade v5.9.2](https://reshade.me/downloads/ReShade_Setup_5.9.2.exe) and the [Vibrant Blues Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/84792?tab=files&file_id=1000127059).
2. Extract and put the ini in Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas.
3. Run ReShade setup.
4. Find FalloutNV.
5. Select DirectX 9 or Vulkan depending on if you use DXVK.
6. Choose a preset ini by clicking browse.
7. Find where you put the ini and select it.
8. Install.

Remove Always run and Auto move keybinds with ESC in your controls settings for better compatibility with B42 bash and bullet time. AMD users will need to use DXVK, which is included in the pack since the newest AMD updates are causing crashes with DX9 games.

</details>

## Tweaks
![](https://i.postimg.cc/c6GrnFd6/tweaks.png)
<details>
<summary>Show Tweaks</summary>

### DXVK

I recommend using [DXVK 1.10.3 - Async](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79299?tab=files&file_id=1000102854) which is included in the mod pack since I found it to be the most stable when it comes to crashes, but if it makes crashes worse or causes visual/performance issues, try the other versions of DXVK or deactivate it. It can be found under the optional separator in your modlist. If you have an AMD GPU, you must use DXVK or you'll face crashes.

### Alt-Tabbing

If you need Alt-tabbing, DXVK covers that. If DXVK doesn't work well with your setup, look at the [Performance guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html) for alt-tabbing or try one tweak which is included in the pack!

### Capping FPS

I highly recommend capping your FPS to 60 with any tool mentioned in this [Performance guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html)!

### V-Sync and Fullscreen

The mod pack by default has Fullscreen enabled and V-Sync disabled. If you have latency issues or lines running down your screen, follow the performance guide. AMD GPU should use Fullscreen for the best performance. Use Flip mode if you have an NVIDIA GPU.

### Resolution Scaling and Frame Generation

For resolution scaling and frame generation, check out the link below. It will have to be purchased sadly. Must have a 40 series Nvidia graphics card to use Frame generation. [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/993090/view/3874849112275096626).

### Latency

You can reduce latency even more by changing low latency mode in the NVIDIA control panel or Anti-lag in AMD Radeon to on. I recommend making the tweak just for the game and not global. This is not recommended if you are struggling for FPS. If you want to try even more latency tweaks, NVIDIA posted a [guide](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/gfecnt/202010/system-latency-optimization-guide/). I don't recommend the Advanced PC Latency Optimization or Overclocking part unless you know what you are doing.

### NVHR

I won't be using NVHR since it causes more memory crashes when using DXVK, but you can play around with it if you'd like [NVHR](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69779). There will be no support if you do.

<details>
<summary>Show Tips</summary>

### General Tips

**Make sure you have no overlays like Overwolf or Discord on as it can make performance worse or cause freezing etc.**

**You will have to reload your save if you want some mods to work like Hitman's animations and B42 notify etc.**

**You can delete the files in the Brutal Wasteland FNV or TTW Downloads folder to free up space, but not recommended if you have bad internet since you'll have to redownload everything again. If you choose to update when updates drop, you'll have to delete it again.**

**Make sure to not pass 255 in your load order!**

### Hardcore Tweaks

## Known Issues

<details>
<summary>Show Known Issues</summary>

- Some of the NPCs' faces will look off.
- Dithering which can be reduced if you get rid of DXVK, apply an FXAA shader through ReShade, NVIDIA control panel Antialiasing, or the dithering reducer preset that came with the mod pack.
- At the start of the game, there's a body that appears in front of Doc Mitchell.
- The interface can sometimes have delays.
- B42 Optics included in the mod pack has visual issues with NVR.
- For TTW, the game freezes near Springvale when going outside from the basement. Didn't happen in version 2.0; might be something I updated or uncapped framerate.
- For TTW, crashing at startup; clearing overwrite in MO2 fixes this or removing any menu plugins.
